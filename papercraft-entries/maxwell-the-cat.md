# Maxwell the Cat
## Made January 2023
[As seen here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRbcDAoK/)

## Notes
- Letter and A4 versions are posted, this is the size of the paper you will print on
- Dingus2 is bigger and has tabs for glue. Dingus1 is what I used to make the original Maxwell, but it has no tabs because I didn't have glue and just wanted to tape. 
- Also included some different sizes, bigger is easier to fold but in case you want smaller, dingus2 smaller versions should turn out to be roughly the size of the Maxwell in my TikTok

Don't know which version to use? I suggest a larger dingus2 :) Making things smaller is harder.

Original model by bean(alwayshasbean) on Sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dingus-the-cat-2ca7f3c1957847d6a145fc35de9046b0 
(this papercraft is based on a slightly modified version without whiskers and lower poly)

ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING: The PNGs are Maxwell from different perspectives in Blender with the red lines signifying the outside edges of the papercraft pieces. I strongly recommend consulting them for reference, otherwise figuring out where all these pieces of the same color go is really hard
