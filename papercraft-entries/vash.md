# Paper Vash
## August 2024/June 2023

Made this guy back in June 2023, told myself I was going to make the hood nicer to fold and/or retexture with some better texturing, and turns out neither happened so here's that old file I was self conscious of.

## Instructions

[Download here! Letter size. Could do A4 on request.](../papercraft-uploads/vash-nolines.pdf)

Print out, fold, and curse my name at the annoying fiddly hood that doesn't need to be that way (sorry in advance).

For folds to look curved ie. the face folds, just don't fold it. Bend the paper so it curves instead of doing harsh folds if you want a soft look.

It's been over a year since the Vash sitting in my cabinet was made but I think you'll probably want to build the base body and then stick on his coat.

For one-sided things with no tab, just glue it straight to wherever it feels right.
