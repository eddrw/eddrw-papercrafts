## Made March 2023

This is Maxwell, in cube form.

## Instructions

Pretty straightforward. My only comments here are that the ears are encased in black squares because I didn't feel like setting up the material to have transparency, so just ignore the black around the actual Maxwell ears, and when attaching the ears, just do whatever looks good. I played with a few folds then glued it where I thought the ears looked best.
